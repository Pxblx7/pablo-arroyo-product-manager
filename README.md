### üöÄ About This Project

This is not a traditional CV. It's an interactive web portfolio designed to present my career as a **Technology Product Manager** in a dynamic and memorable way. The concept is inspired by the "player cards" from the world of sports, using visualizations and animations to tell a story of impact, strategy, and results.

The project was born from the reinvention of the `futdupe.com` domain, transforming an initial idea into a powerful personal branding tool that demonstrates not only my experience but also my ability to pivot and create products from scratch.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This site was built from the ground up using a modern, performance-focused stack:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **CSS Framework:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **Animations:** [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
* **Data Visualization:** [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
* **Analytics:** [PostHog](https://posthog.com/)

The project is contained within a single `index.html` file and does not use complex JavaScript frameworks to ensure maximum loading speed.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **100% Responsive Design:** Adaptable to any device.
* **Fluid Animations with GSAP:** Micro-interactions and entrance animations that guide the user through the content.
* **Interactive Radar Chart:** A skill visualization that animates on scroll.
* **Career Timeline:** A visual journey through my professional experience, enriched with logos and animations.

* **Bilingual Functionality:** Full support for Spanish and English.
* **Informative Tooltips:** Interactivity in my toolkit to display years of experience.
